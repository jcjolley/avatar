	Although all database and hibernate configuration parameters are drawn from Guice, this
	file is required by JPA (blah), and it must exist in the same JAR that has your @Entity classes.
	However, this file need contain nothing more than what you see here.

	The name "gw-persistence-unit" is a default; if you wish to change it, you must pass in your
	alternative name to the HibernateModule constructor.
